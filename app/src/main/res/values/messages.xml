        Its been a long time since you have received your last update. Sorry for the delay and thanks for your patience.
        I have incorporated several changes in the user interface, including support for landscape orientation, sliding up music player, a new play pause button, besides fixing several bugs in previous versions.
        Since I am a lone developer with limited set of test devices (one to be precise), I rely solely upon feedback from my users. Which is why I would encourage you to join the beta program. Just drop a mail and I shall add you to my beta list.
        Beta users are promised to be ridden of frequent full screen popup ads.
